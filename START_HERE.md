## 🎓 Understanding the Project

### File Organization
```
pdf-telegram-bot/
├── bot.py              ← Main application (start here)
├── config.py           ← Settings and configuration
├── handlers/           ← Command handlers (/start, /merge, etc.)
├── utils/              ← PDF processing and file management
└── [docs]              ← README, DEPLOY, TESTING guides
```

### How It Works
```
1. User uploads PDF → Bot stores in temp directory
2. User types command → Handler processes request
3. PDF operation → Uses PyPDF2/pikepdf/pdf2image
4. Result sent → User gets processed file
5. Cleanup → All temp files deleted automatically
```

### Key Technologies
- **python-telegram-bot** - Telegram Bot API wrapper
- **PyPDF2** - PDF merging and splitting
- **pikepdf** - PDF compression
- **pdf2image** - PDF to image conversion
- **Pillow** - Image processing
